# Change Point Colors for Different Lines in ggplot2 Graph in R

# This tutorial explains how to adjust the point colors for different lines in ggplot2 line and point graph in R programming.

# Setting up the Example
head(iris) # preview the iris data frame

# Basic Line and Point Graph
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
ggplot(iris,                     # Graphic without any colors
       aes(x = Sepal.Length,
           y = Petal.Length,
           group = Species)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
# What is the difference between the two graphs?
# The first graph uses the color aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The second graph uses the group aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The first graph uses color to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The second graph uses the group aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The first graph uses color to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The second graph uses the group aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The first graph uses the color aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers. The second graph uses the group aesthetic to differentiate between the three species of iris flowers.

# How does the group aesthetic work?
# The group aesthetic is used to group data points together. 
ggplot(iris,                     # Graphic without any colors
       aes(x = Sepal.Length,
           y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() # No color, no group

# Example: Adjusting the Color of Points in a ggplot2 Line & Point Plot by Group
ggplot(iris,                     # Change color of scatterplot points by group
       aes(x = Sepal.Length,
           y = Petal.Length,
           group = Species)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(col = Species)) # Change color of points by group
