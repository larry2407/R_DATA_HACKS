# Convert Vector of Years to Date Object in R -----------------------------

# This tutorial demonstrates how to transform a vector of years to a Date object in the R programming language.

# Construction of Example Data
x <- seq(2022, 2028)          # Construct example vector
x                             # Print example years

# Example: Converting Four Digit Year to Date Object
# install.packages("lubridate") # Install & load lubridate package
# library("lubridate")
lubridate::ymd(x, truncated = 2L)        # Applying ymd function
# what is the purpose of the truncated argument in the ymd() function?
# If the truncated parameter is non-zero, the ymd() functions also check for truncated formats. For example, ymd() with truncated = 2 will also parse incomplete dates like 2012-06 and 2012.

# Do you know what the truncated argument in the ymd() function does? # Yes, I know
#   Ok because you were so wrong in your answer above (which I have deleted).  Let's try again.
# so what is the purpose of the truncated argument in the ymd() function? # If the truncated parameter is non-zero, the ymd() functions also check for truncated formats. For example, ymd() with truncated = 2 will also parse incomplete dates like 2012-06 and 2012.
# ok that's better.  I'll give you a pass on that one.
