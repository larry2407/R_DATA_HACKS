# Calculate Correlation of One Data Frame Column to All Others in R -------

# In this article youâ€™ll learn how to compute the correlation of one data frame column to all the others in R.

# Creation of Example Data
data(iris)                   # Example data
iris_new <- iris[ , c(1:4)]
head(iris_new)

# Example: Applying cor() Function Get Correlations of One Column with All Others
cor(iris_new[ , - 1],        # Get correlation estimates
    iris_new$Sepal.Length)
